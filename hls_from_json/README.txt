this is an old version of hls which is not really correct.

It takes in a CFG in json format and outputs cycles, energy, and hardware. There is also support for asap and alap scheduling.

The user must specify the path to the CFG file in order for the program to run (in main function).

I have included an example CFG in pdf form for reference.
